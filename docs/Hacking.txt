# Testing the code.

To test the code, cd into the top-level directory and run pytest.

Logging output is generated as the tests run. If you want to see this in real time, use the -s switch. I personally like to include the -q switch so I don't see the platform that I'm running on ETC. So my full command is:
py.test -sq

If you're paranoid, you can include the tests directory like so:
py.test -sq tests

But Pytest seems to find it quite happily on it's own.
